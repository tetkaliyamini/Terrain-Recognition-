This project focuses on terrain recognition using machine learning, with the aim of accurately classifying various landform s from satellite images. Utilizing a labeled dataset containing six distinct terrain types—marshy, rocky, forest, desert, cloud, and sea—the project leverages image recognition techniques to classify the terrain in each image. Four machine learning models were explored: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree. Among these, the Random Forest classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy in recognizing terrain types, making it the most effective model for this application. This solution provides a reliable approach for remote sensing and geographic analysis tasks, enabling efficient classification of satellite images into different terrain categories, which can be valuable in environmental monitoring, resource management, and land-use planning
